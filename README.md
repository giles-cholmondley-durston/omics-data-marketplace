#### Information about this project

I am co-founding a startup which aims to radically increase the quantity of high-quality omics data available to the world.

Omics data includesâ€”

- genomic
- epigenomic
- transcriptomic
- proteomic
- metagenomic
- metaepigenomic etc

This data is extremely valuable to healthcare companies and researchers. They use it to train their models in developing new drugs and treatments for a large range of diseases including common and rare cancers, Alzheimer's, general aging and many others.

I would like to start with a simple marketplace where existing data providers
can upload and set a price for their data.
